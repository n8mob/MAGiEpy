* DONE Fix crash when level has no puzzles
CLOSED: [2024-01-13 Sat 16:27]

* TODO Add a space between letters in 5bA1 decode puzzles

* DONE add menu option to quit
CLOSED: [2024-01-05 Fri 13:07]

CLOSED: [2024-01-04 Thu 16:10]
* DONE Add a "back" option when selecting levels
CLOSED: [2024-01-04 Thu 15:47]

* FIXED after finishing a level, category selection does not work   :console:
CLOSED: [2023-10-06 Fri 19:32]
oh! only CursesMAGiE implements finish_level :facepalm:

* FIXED wrong-length guesses are bad                    :console:fixedlength:
CLOSED: [2023-10-08 Sun 16:19]


* DONE alpha-length decoding puzzle
CLOSED: [2023-10-09 Mon 19:55]

* DONE 5ba1 decoding puzzle
CLOSED: [2023-10-14 Sat 12:46]

* DONE Remove curses imports from all files that are required for console magie
CLOSED: [2023-10-06 Fri 18:43]
This should allow the script to run in Pythonista.

* FIXED variable-length bit-judgment does not indicate incorrect last letter
CLOSED: [2023-10-06 Fri 18:10]

I think if the guess is too long (of the correct bit) it marks it correct and assumes the next bit is part of the next character... not sure. I think it'll be good to err on the side of leniency in this version of the game.

* FIXED Exclamation point at end of variable win text is not judged correctly
CLOSED: [2023-09-24 Sun 14:52]
Seems fixed.
Unit tests passed.

* FIXED win_bits.pop(0) is crashing
CLOSED: [2023-09-12 Tue 11:33]
I think I put that on when win_bits was a list of lists (or list of strings)
1 bit-string(list) for each character
Now I'm using win_bits as a full string with no breaks (better for variable-width encodings)

Removed the pop and just judged the whole string at once.

* FIXED character-level correctness is lost
CLOSED: [2023-09-20 Wed 19:12]

* FIXED "judged" bits of first correct character displaying for every character
CLOSED: [2023-09-20 Wed 19:12]
And sometimes incorrectly at that.

* DONE output guess and correctness on separate lines
CLOSED: [2023-09-12 Tue 11:34]

* DONE do not add wrong guesses to guess text
CLOSED: [2023-09-04 Mon 16:28]

* DONE Multi-bit guess
CLOSED: [2023-09-04 Mon 16:21]
for ConsoleMAGiE (where you have to press <enter> every time)

* DONE Extract Display
CLOSED: [2023-08-29 Tue 17:32]
Idea: make the rest of the code more modular and therefore easier to test
- [X] Categories don't show up
"done", but not really.  

* DONE backspace over mistakes
** backspace fifth bit
(that is: bit where index = encoding.width)
1. [X] if guess bits are not empty, pop the last one

* DONE sixth bit crashes the game
CLOSED: [2023-08-20 Sun 10:04]
* DONE bug decoded letter padding changes as bits are entered
CLOSED: [2023-08-20 Sun 10:01]
* DONE take in bits
CLOSED: [2023-08-19 Sat 19:56]
* DONE correct width                                                    :bug:
CLOSED: [2023-08-19 Sat 18:27]
* DONE overwrite wrong guesses
CLOSED: [2023-08-19 Sat 18:19]
